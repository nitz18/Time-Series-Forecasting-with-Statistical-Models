Time Series Forecasting with Statistical Models - Python, Statsmodels, Numpy, Pandas

Used exogenous and endogenous variables to predict the production quantity of maple syrup for different regions. Performed ADF test and differenced the data, built a SARIMAX model using Auto ARIMA on the data

### Goal

We have been given the monthly production quantity for a certain agricultural product (letâ€™s call it Grople syrup, note - no relation to actual Maple Syrup) in 10 different provinces of a country between January 2015 to December 2020. This Grople syrup comes from a fruit. It takes a few months for the fruits to grow on the trees which bear them. It also takes a few days to extract the syrup from the fruits after they have been harvested.

We would like to predict the production quantity for Grople syrup from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021.
